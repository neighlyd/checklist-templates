# Checklist Templates

#### Checklist Templates is currently in development. Check back later for releases and updates.

## Statement of Intent
The Checklist Templates program allows users to create a variety of checklists, as well as create unique checklist templates that they can use to generate new checklists. For example, it is possible to have a 'Groceries' template that has your weekly grocery list. Every week you can simply create a new grocery checklist from the 'Groceries' template, make any changes you need to for that week, and then check items off as needed. The original 'Groceries' template will remain unchanged.
